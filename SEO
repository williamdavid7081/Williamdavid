Search Engine: A web search engine is a software system that is designed to search
for information on the World Wide Web. The search results are generally presented in a line of
results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs).
The information may be a mix of web pages, images and other types of files. Unlike web
directories they are maintained by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time
information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.
Search Engine Results Pages (SERP): Are the pages displayed by
search engines in response to a query by a searcher. The main component of the SERP is the
listing of results that are returned by the search engine in response to a keyword query, although
the pages may also contain other results such as advertisements.
The results are of two general types, organic search (retrieved by the search engine&#39;s algorithm)
and sponsored search (advertisements). The results are normally ranked by relevance to the
query. Each result displayed on the SERP normally includes a title, a link that points to the actual
page on the Web, and a short description showing where the keywords have matched content
within the page for organic results.
The SERP of major search engines, like Google, Yahoo, and Bing are many different types
results of organic search .
HOW SEARCH ENGINE WORKS
Crawling
It involves scanning sites and collecting details about each page: titles, images, keywords, other
linked pages etc. But how is a website crawled? An automated bot (called a “spider”) visits page
after page as quickly as possible, using page links to find where to go next. Even in the earliest
days, Google’s spiders could read several hundred pages per second. Nowadays, it’s in the
thousands. When a web crawler visits a page, it collects every link on the page and adds them to
its list of next pages to visit. It goes to the next page in its list, collects the links on that page, and
repeats. Web crawlers also revisit past pages once in a while to see if any changes happened.
Some sites are crawled more frequently, some are crawled to greater depths but sometimes a
crawler may give up if a site’s page content is too complex.
Indexing

Indexing is when the data from a crawl is processed and placed in a database. Ex. imagine
 making a list of all the books you own, their publishers, their authors, their genres, their page
counts, etc. Crawling is when you comb through each book while indexing is when you log them
to your list.
Retrieval
Retrieval is when the search engine processes your search query and returns the most relevant
pages that match your query. Most search engines differentiate themselves through their retrieval
methods: they use different criteria to pick and choose which pages fit best with what you want
to find. That’s why search results vary between Google and Bing, and why Wolfram Alpha is so
uniquely useful.
Ranking
Ranking algorithms check your search query against millions of pages to determine each one’s
relevance. Companies guard their ranking algorithms as patented industry secrets due to their
complexity. A better algorithm translates to a better search experience.
They also don’t want web creators to game the system and unfairly climb to the tops of search
results. If the internal methodology of a search engine ever got out, all kinds of people would
surely exploit that knowledge to the detriment of searchers like you and me.
Importance of Ranking
Page rank is important because it’s one of the factors a search engine like Google takes into
account when it decides which results to show at the top of its search engine listings – where
they can be easily seen. In fact Page Rank is a Google trade mark but other search engines use
similar techniques.
SEO : Search Engine Optimization is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a
web page in a search engine’s unpaid results or we can say that it is the process of optimizing
your online content so that a search engine likes to show it as a top result for searches of a certain
keyword.

What is On-Page SEO?
On-page SEO also known as on-site SEO is the act of optimizing different parts of your website
that affect your search engine rankings. It&#39;s stuff that you have control over and can change on
your own website.

What is Off-Page SEO?
Off-page SEO focuses on increasing the authority of your domain through the act of getting links
from other websites. There&#39;s a score called &quot;Domain Authority&quot; that calculates how authoritative
your website is compared to other sites.
